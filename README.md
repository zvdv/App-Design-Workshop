# App-Design-Workshop

A series of workshops presented at the College of Science and Technology, Phuentsholing, Bhutan.

## Part 1: Intro to Figma

In this workshop, we explored everything needed to create complex, interactive designs in Figma through hands-on examples. Topics included: shapes, text, styles, frames, constraints, auto layout, components and variants. `Figma Workshop Recap.pdf` contains a summary of the workshop with suggestions and links for further learning.

## Part 2: Intro to Flutter

In this workshop, we learned how to bring designs to life on any device using Flutter. During the workshop, each participant created a project from the Empty Application template and developed an app similar to `inventory`. This example demonstrated a few key functions such as navigating between pages, updating values in the UI (state), and reusing custom widgets.
